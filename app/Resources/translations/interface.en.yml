experience.manage.introductionText: You may have lived in this current city for years and find the idea of a theme oriented experience a bit limitating... Well, here you can create a new experience with a different flavor to propose another version of your city to travelers. For example, if you already propose a culture oriented visit of your town, you can also propose a second experience about the nightlife and the different things happening by night! Let your knowledge of the city talk and try to intrigued the potential visitors ;)
